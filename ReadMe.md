## R package primer: a minimal tutorial

R packages are the best way to distribute R code and documentation,
and, despite the impression that the official manual
([Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html))
might give, they are really are rather simple to create.

Even for code that you don't plan to distribute, you'll find it is
easier to keep track of your own personal R functions if they are in a
package. And it's good to write documentation, even if it's just for
your future self.

[Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz) is writing
[a book about the basics of R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/). You might just
jump straight there. But there is value in having a diversity of
resources, so I thought I'd go ahead and write my own minimal tutorial.
